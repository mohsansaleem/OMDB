# OMDB
This is simple IMDB Data explorer projects. I have implemented aysnc loading of data and images with awesome animation of data loading and removal on Query update. Also there is a History stack for details Window on selection of related movies.

Searches the IMDB and shows the result asynchronously. On receiving the Json we request the respective Cover Image and we add the Movie Node to the list on receiving the image.
There is also local cache which caching the request results and Images so we won't need to request some images again.
